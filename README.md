# The codes in this repository have made possible my bachelor thesis. Now, they are publicly available for anyone to try them. There are comments in the codes so that they are fully understandable. 

# train_alexnet. mlx and train_resnet50.mlx are two codes that take a datastore and CNNs AlexNet and ResNet50, respectively. Then, the networks are trained and the datastore is classified, getting confusion matrices, ROC curves and more relevant data on the performance of both training and validation data.

# resnet_loss_WCE.mlx is very simmilar to the previous ones, except for the fact that in this one CNN ResNet50 is train by using Weighted Cross Entropy instead of Cross ENtropy as loss function.

# size_change_images.mlx takes an image datastore from a directory, changes it to the desired size (in this case for feeding the CNNs) and saves them in another directory.

# train_My_Neural_Style_Transfer.mlx takes a style image and a datastore and train a Neural Style Transfer model to change any image to the style of the style image.
